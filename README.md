# Automation of Spotify playlist creation using high dimensional data with K-means clustering algorithm        

### The goal of this project is to use a clustering algorithm to break down a large playlist into smaller ones.. 



## K_Means Clustering Algorithm Implementation From Scratch
K-Means is the most popular clustering algorithm. It uses an iterative technique to group unlabeled data into K clusters based on cluster centers (centroids). The data in each cluster are chosen such that their average distance to their respective centroid is minimized.

## Introduction:

The "Automation of Spotify Playlist Creation using High Dimensional Data with K-means Clustering Algorithm" project is aimed at creating an intelligent music recommendation system that creates playlists automatically based on a user's music preferences. This project uses high dimensional data and the K-means clustering algorithm to analyze a user's music preferences and create playlists that reflect their taste.
 

## Methodology:

The project uses high dimensional data from the Spotify API, including audio features such as danceability, energy, and tempo, to analyze a user's music preferences. The K-means clustering algorithm is then used to cluster the songs based on these features and create playlists that reflect the user's taste. The algorithm is trained using a dataset of songs that are similar to the user's preferences and can create playlists with high accuracy.

## Results:

The project has been successfully implemented and tested, and the results are promising. The playlists created by the algorithm are highly personalized and reflect the user's music preferences. The algorithm can also adapt to changes in the user's preferences and update the playlists accordingly.

## Conclusion:

The "Automation of Spotify Playlist Creation using High Dimensional Data with K-means Clustering Algorithm" project is a significant step towards creating an intelligent music recommendation system that can automate the playlist creation process. The project has shown promising results and can be further improved by incorporating more advanced machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques. The code and documentation for this project can be found in this GitHub repository.
